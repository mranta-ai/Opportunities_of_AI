## Opportunities of AI
*Mikko Ranta*

The following chapters present examples of AI applications. The chapters have an introductory section followed by sections of practical examples that use Python code and are hopefully easy to follow.
* Chapter 1 introduces computer vision in more detail.
* Chapter 2 focuses on natural language processing methods.
* Chapter 3 is about decision making and explainable AI.
